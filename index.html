<p class="bold" >The United States announced on Friday it was <a class="none" href="#"> revoking the designation </a> of Yemen’s <br>
     Houthi rebels as a terrorist group effective February 16, a reversal by the Biden <br> administration which was welcomed by the United Nations and humanitarian <br>  groups who feared former president Donald Trump’s actions would impede aid   <br> deliveries to the conflict-torn country facing the world’s worst humanitarian
      crisis.</p>
<p class="style">
    US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called President Joe Biden’s decision to rescind <br>
     the designation “a recognition of the dire humanitarian situation in Yemen”. He said <br> the new US administration listened to warnings from the United Nations, humanitarian  <br>  groups, bipartisan members of Congress and others “that the designations could  <br>  have a devastating impact on Yemenis’ access to basic commodities like food and  <br> fuel”.
</p>
<p class="style">
    Yemen imports 90 per cent of its food, nearly all purchased through commercial <br> channels, and UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock warned last month that the US <br> designation of the Houthis already had companies pulling back from dealing with the <br> Yemenis and would likely lead to “a large-scale famine on a scale that we have not <br> seen for nearly 40 years”.
</p>
<p class="style">
    Blinken’s announcement followed a phone conversation on Thursday with UN <br>
    Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, where Yemen was one of the issues they <br>
     discussed. UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric on Friday called the US action “extremely <br>
      positive”. “We hope that helps build momentum for a political solution to the conflict in <br>
      Yemen,” Dujarric said. “I think the reversal of the designation, the naming of the [US] <br>
      special envoy [for Yemen], and the clear, clear language from the top of the <br>
      administration, from president Biden himself, expressing his strong support for the UN- <br>
      led mediation process [...] are very, very welcome indeed.”
</p>
<p class="style">
    In 2014, the rebel Houthis overran the capital, Sanaa, and much of Yemen’s north, <br>
     driving the government into exile. A US-backed, Saudi-led coalition intervened the <br>
     following year to try and restore the internationally recognised government, but years <br>
      of UN efforts to get both sides to agree to a ceasefire and start peace negotiations <br>
        have not succeeded. The conflict has been disastrous for Yemen, the Arab world’s <br>
       poorest country, killing more than 112,000 people, creating a humanitarian disaster, <br>
        and wrecking infrastructure from roads and hospitals to water and electricity <br>
         networks.
</p>
<p class="style">
    The State Department confirmed last week that Biden was moving to revoke the <br>
     designation, a day after the president announced an end to  <br>
    offensive support to Saudi Arabia’s campaign against the Houthis.
